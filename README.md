# speedcontrol-highlighting

Expansion bundle that works alongside [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) that allows you to make Twitch highlights from within the NodeCG dashboard, and can also be automated.

This bundle's code was once a part of [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol), but was split into it's own bundle due to it's experimental nature. Currently it is undocumented but if you want to try it out, you can probably figure out how it works.
